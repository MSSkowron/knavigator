# Metrics and Dashboard

Knavigator operates in tandem with the Prometheus node resource exporter, which emits metrics detailing the utilization of resources at the node level. These metrics assist in pinpointing potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the scheduling framework.
Moreover, Knavigator's functionality relies on a Prometheus server  to execute tasks that evaluate PromQL queries.
